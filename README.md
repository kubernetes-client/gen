# Generating a client
To generate a client, first make sure the client generator exists. For any language other than
go, check `openapi/` folder for a script with `${CLIENT_LANGUAGE}.sh` and run this command:

```bash
${CLIENT_LANGUAGE}.sh OUTPUT_DIR SETTING_FILE
```

`SETTING_FILE` is a bash script exporting required setting to generate a client. These
are normally:

- `KUBERNETES_BRANCH`: The kubernetes branch to get OpenAPI spec from. e.g. "master"
- `CLIENT_VERSION`: Client version string. e.g. "1.0.0b1"
- `PACKAGE_NAME`: Package name for the generated client. e.g. "kubernetes"

Example settings file for python-client:

export KUBERNETES_BRANCH="master"
export CLIENT_VERSION="8.0.0b1"
export PACKAGE_NAME="client"

Note: For generating the client for any language, the PACKAGE_NAME should be "client".
      You can use the latest version for the CLIENT_VERSION. It's displayed here for
      the python-client ( https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python ), and similarly
      for other language clients. 

Recommended structure is to generate client in a folder called `kubernetes` at the root of
the client repo and put all settings in a file named `settings` at the root of the repo.
If you followed these recommendations, you can simply run autoupdate script anywhere inside
the client repo:

```bash
cd ${CLIENT_ROOT}/...
${GEN_REPO_ROOT}/openapi/autoupdate.sh
```
